## Intro
BlackjackJS is a game of classic blackjack made in Javascript(ECMA) & HTML.

## Instructions 
Press a bet button to start the game, if you can afford it. You will now be promted with two choices, Hit & Stand.

Hit: Will give you another card, but be careful! You lose, if your score reaches higer than 21!
Stand: Your score will be locked! It is now the dealers turn! The dealer draws a new card and adds it to their score if their score is under 17.

Good luck!
